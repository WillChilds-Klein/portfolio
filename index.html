## Patent Trolls in the Tweetosphere
![](img/tweets.png)

_Patent Trolls in the Tweetosphere_ (live link [here](http://will.childs-kle.in/cpsc183-final/)) was a final project for Law, Technology, and Culture (CPSC 183) taught by Brad Rosen in the fall of 2014. The goal of the project was to investigate the rise of [patent trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll), using Twitter as a proxy for measuring public awareness of their practices. The findings were divided into three twitter-related sections (mentions by year, mentions by state, and sentiment by year) and a breakdown of plaintiff company type for the 10 US disctrict courts most active in patent assertion cases. We found that the states containing two of the three most active patent districts (Eastern Texas, Central California) were also among the three states with the most twitter mentions of patent troll-related phrases from 2010-2014. We were also able to correlate various spikes in twitter mentions of the phrase "patent troll" or "patent monetization entity" with prominent patent cases and their reporting in the media (e.g. _Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International_ Mar. '14 - Jun. '14).

wambam! was a very fun project that myself and a group of 5 others built over the course of the spring '14 semester for a Software Engineering course (CPSC 439). The abbreviated pitch for the app can be stated as "uber for tasks". Essentially, we aimed to create a marketplace for favors within the Yale community. A user would sign up with their `@yale.edu` email address, and either request a task or browse tasks posted on a map to fulfill for payment. A user would request a task by dropping a pin on the app's map and enter a description of the task, expiration time date, pertinent locations other than the pin drop, their contact information, and the fee they are willing to pay for the task's completion. One obvious problem with this sort of crowd-sourcing is protecting against bad actors. Our solution to this problem was by restricting sign ups to only people with `@yale.edu` email addresses, as these are very difficult to obtain or counterfeit and are thus a workable  proxy for trust. Had we had more time to devote to the project, we would have liked to actually launch it (sadly, although the app was fully functional, this never happened) and implement a counter-offer system for task prices such that task fulfillers could negotiate fair task fees.

In the summer of 2013, my friend [Seth Thompson](https://seththompson.org/) and I were commissioned to build a website for the matching graduating senior's at what our school called (appropriately) the Last Chance Dance. We built the app in a few weeks with Ruby on Rails. The implementation of the site was dead simple: each user enters the email of seven people they were interested in, and notifying emails would be sent to both parties if two users mutually specified eachother. We launched the site in early May of 2013, maintaining it through the end of the month with almost a thousand users, producing over a hundred matches.
